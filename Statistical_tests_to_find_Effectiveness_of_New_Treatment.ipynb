However, it's important to keep in mind that these tests were performed on simulated data and that in real-world medical research, multiple tests should be run as well as other statistical and non-statistical analysis before making any conclusions. Additionally, these tests are inferential in nature and based on the sample data, we cannot conclude anything about the population. It should be used as an evidence to support or reject the hypothesis."
