# Regression Analysis of Stock Data
This project focuses on performing regression analysis on stock data to gain insights and make predictions using statistical methods. The analysis was conducted using Python and R, utilizing libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and nltk.

## Project Highlights
1. Performed quantitative analysis and statistical tests on stock data.
2. Utilized hypothesis testing, normality tests, and sample correlations to analyze the data.
3. Applied the central limit theorem to make inferences about the population based on sample data.
4. Developed linear and multilinear regression models to predict stock prices.
5. Compared the performance and effectiveness of different models.
